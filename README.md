# About

I believe in #LifeLongLearning and I hope to actively document this process as I learn by doing, which hopefully helps me gain deeper knowledge of various topics.

This repo is my container(!) for my notes/etc from my dive into Kubernetes. I've previously played around with [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) and [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service](https://aws.amazon.com/eks) but in order to gain a deeper understanding, I decided it would be worthwhile to take a more barebones approach.

I first started by going through Kelsey Hightower's [Kubernetes The Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way), and now I'm working through [this adaptation for AWS](https://github.com/prabhatsharma/kubernetes-the-hard-way-aws) by Prabhat Sharma.

## Kubernetes The Hard Way

- [Kubernetes The Hard Way - GCP](docs/k8s-the-hard-way-gcp.md) - *Completed but yet to document everything here*
- [Kubernetes The Hard Way - AWS](docs/k8s-the-hard-way-aws.md) - *ongoing*
