Learning Notes - Kubernetes 

As part of #LifeLongLearning, I hope to actively document what I am currently learning. This process hopefully will help me gain deeper knowledge of various topics. 

This repo documents my initial dive into Kubernetes. I've previously played around with Google's GKE and Amazon's EKS but in order to gain a deeper understanding, I decided it would be worthwhile to take a somewhat agnostic approach. 

I first started by going through Kelsey Hightower's Kubernetes The Hard Way and now I'm working through this adaptation https://github.com/prabhatsharma/kubernetes-the-hard-way-aws
